                        <strong>(a) Our Contract</strong>
                        <br>
When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgment e-mail confirming receipt of your order: this is not an acceptance of your order. No contract is formed until Joy Organics transmit an e-mail confirmation that the goods that you ordered have been shipped to you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of shipment will be included in the contract formed.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>(b) Pricing and Availability</strong>
                        <br>
Errors in product details, descriptions and prices may occur despite efforts to ensure accuracy. If Joy Organics discovers an error in the price of any goods that you have ordered, then Joy Organics will inform you regarding the error, and you will have the option of either reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If Joy Organics is unable to contact you, then Joy Organics will treat the order as cancelled. If you cancel the order after you have already paid for the goods, then you will receive a full refund.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Delivery costs are in addition to product prices.

                        <strong>(c) Payment</strong>
                        <br>
On receipt of your order Joy Organics will seek authorization for payment from your card issuer. Your card will be debited upon receipt of that authorization, and funds received will be treated as a deposit against the value of the goods you have ordered for purchase.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>(d) Returns and Refunds</strong>
                        <br>
All products are sold with a thirty (30) day refund policy. If you are not satisfied with your purchase for any reason within thirty days after your purchase, then Joy Organics give you a full refund of your purchase price.
